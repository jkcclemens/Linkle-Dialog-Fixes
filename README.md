# Linkle-Dialog-Fixes
This github is for the linkle Dialog fixes (which we edit)
We do not own anything in this github, nor did We make all the of modifications here.
this is simply here to track and fix issues with the dialog. 
**All credit goes to Avresa, AnalogMan, Eloeri and anyone else who worked on this that I'm not aware of.**

Wii u: https://gamebanana.com/guis/34282
Switch: https://gamebanana.com/guis/34268 
(This repo is based on the switch edition I'm not aware of what differences between switch and Wii U are.)

# I noticed an error in the dialog!
Please take a screenshot and then go to issues, and submit an issue using the format included.

# I'd like to help fix issues
Great! :D anyone is welcome to edit and make a pull request.
Please make sure to note everything changed as we have to go file by file otherwise, we may just deny the pull request

# How to properly do a pull request:
First, find all the files you changed, and make a pull request with the following information
What you changed, why you changed it, and finally the Spot in each msbt you edited.

EX: 
Pull request with the file ActorType/ArmorHead.msbt edited
I changed the word hero to heroine in ArmorHead:Armor_039_Head_Desc


# I'd like to help, but how do I edit these msbt files?
go download https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-msbt-editor-reloaded.406208/
This program allows you to edit these files fairly simply.
Please don't delete any symbols you don't recognize as they often are place holders for information the game needs to find / use the dialog.
