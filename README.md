# Linkle-Dialog-Fixes
This github is for the linkle Dialog fixes (which we edit) <br >
We do not own anything in this github, nor did We make all the of modifications here. <br >
this is simply here to track and fix issues with the dialog. <br > 
**All credit goes to Avresa, AnalogMan, Eloeri and anyone else who worked on this that I'm not aware of.** <br >

Wii u: https://gamebanana.com/guis/34282 <br >
Switch: https://gamebanana.com/guis/34268 <br >
(This repo is based on the switch edition I'm not aware of what differences between switch and Wii U are.) <br >

# I noticed an error in the dialog!
Please take a screenshot and then go to issues, and submit an issue using the format included. <br >

# I'd like to help fix issues
Great! :D anyone is welcome to edit and make a pull request. <br >
Please make sure to note everything changed as we have to go file by file otherwise, we may just deny the pull request <br >

# How to properly do a pull request:
First, find all the files you changed, and make a pull request with the following information <br >
What you changed, why you changed it, and finally the Spot in each msbt you edited. <br >

EX: 
Pull request with the file ActorType/ArmorHead.msbt edited <br >
I changed the word hero to heroine in ArmorHead:Armor_039_Head_Desc <br >


# I'd like to help, but how do I edit these msbt files?
go download https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-msbt-editor-reloaded.406208/ <br >
This program allows you to edit these files fairly simply. <br >
Please don't delete any symbols you don't recognize as they often are place holders for information the game needs to find / use the dialog. <br >
