# Linkle-Dialog-Fixes - WiiU Branch
This github is for the Linkle dialog fixes (which we edit)<br>
We do not own anything in this github, nor did we make all the of modifications here.<br>
This is simply here to track and fix issues with the dialog.<br>
**All credit goes to Avresa, AnalogMan, Eloeri and anyone else who worked on this that I'm not aware of.**<br>

WiiU: https://gamebanana.com/guis/34282<br>
Switch: https://gamebanana.com/guis/34268<br>
(This branch is based on the WiiU edition, although I'm not aware of what the differences between Switch and WiiU are.)<br>

# I noticed an error in the dialog!
Please take a screenshot and then go to issues, and submit an issue using the format included.<br>

# I'd like to help fix issues
Great! :D Anyone is welcome to edit and make a pull request.<br>
Please make sure to note everything changed as we have to go file by file, otherwise, we may just deny the pull request.<br>

# How to properly do a pull request:
First, find all the files you changed, and make a pull request with the following information.<br>
What you changed, why you changed it, and finally the spot in each .msbt you edited.<br>

EX: 
Pull request with the file ActorType/ArmorHead.msbt edited.<br>
I changed the word hero to heroine in ActorType/ArmorHead.msbt/Armor_039_Head_Desc<br>


# I'd like to help, but how do I edit these msbt files?
Go download https://github.com/IcySon55/3DLandMSBTeditor/releases/latest<br>
This program allows you to edit these files fairly simply.<br>
Please don't delete any symbols you don't recognize as they often are place holders for information the game needs to display special formatting.<br>
