I bet you think\nthis is just a myth, right?\n\nThen what do you say about all the\npeople who claim to have seen a glowing\nblue bunny in the forest lately?\nYou probably say, \"Oh, Traysi, thank you\nfor writing volume 6!\" Sound about\nright?\nYou should say that, because the blue\nbunny is the light the hunter saw!\n\nFinding it means finding lots and lots of\nrupees! I can't endorse this bit of gossip\nenough!\nTraysi's Recommendation: "
